# Walmart-Sales-Analysis
Project Overview
This project involves transforming raw retail data into a structured MySQL database to analyze the impact of various factors—such as temperature, fuel prices, and unemployment—on Walmart's weekly sales. The goal was to build a robust data pipeline that provides actionable business intelligence through advanced SQL techniques.

Technical Skills Demonstrated
Data Cleaning & ETL: Handled date standardization, data type casting, and safe-update constraints.
Advanced SQL: Window functions (RANK(), LAG()), CTEs (Common Table Expressions), and complex aggregations.
Feature Engineering: Created data buckets for environmental factors and mapped holiday-specific categories.
Database Programmability: Developed Stored Procedures for dynamic reporting and Views for simplified data access.

Key Insights
The Holiday Effect: Sales spikes were most significant during the weeks leading up to Christmas and Thanksgiving.
Economic Resilience: Analyzed the correlation between Unemployment rates and sales, determining whether Walmart's performance is affected by local economic downturns.
Weather Patterns: Identified a "sweet spot" temperature range (60°F–80°F) where sales volume typically peaks.
